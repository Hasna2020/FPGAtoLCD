In this video we introduce the series that covers programming an FPGA to output to a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). This will be a great series for starters since this is how I started. It will move through how to turn on a Light Emitting Diode via programming or a button, then how to repetitively change a bank of LED outputs. Then finally, how to sequence a bank of outputs that can be used to drive an LCD display. The progression of this series will ultimately show how to go from very basic to intermediate concepts. I have listed below links to the parts needed.</br>

Breadboard: https://amzn.to/3dnsKgY</br>
(This breadboard is different from the original one. The original was terrible to work with, I would suggest this board instead.)</br>

I'm not sure if the LCD needs any soldering but if so, I would recommend the Hakko that I use:</br>
